Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab11.asm. Identify the cause of each error.

The Errors:
- .ORIG at the beginning
- .END at the end
- LD R2 #14 
- LD R5 #5
- STI --> ST #242
- BRpz --> BRzp

There were some errors, which included not typing .ORIG at the beginning and .END at the end. There was also a problem of writing the address in place of the number of spaces that the program counter has to go to for the LD function. 

Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 

OUTERLOOP: x3005
INNERLOOP: x3006
INPUT: x300E
RESULT: x30FF

Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?

labeling memory locations/offsets helps coders understand the code and debug it when needed. it also makes code interpretation easier.
